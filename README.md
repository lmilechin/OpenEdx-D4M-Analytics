# OpenEdx-D4M-Analytics

This project contains tools, parsers, and instructions for creating your own OpenEdx Analytics Pipeline using Matlab/Octave or Julia D4M.

To get started you will need GNU Octave and Julia, both of which are open source.  The software can be found at

   * GNU Octave:  https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
   * GNU Octave Download: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/#install

   * Julia Home:  https://julialang.org/
   * Julia Download: https://julialang.org/downloads/

Both languages include packages for Windows, Mac OS and Linux as well as the source code for those who need or wish to build from source.

To complete the projects, you will also need the D4M Libraries.  These can be found at:
